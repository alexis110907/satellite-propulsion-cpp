# satellite-propulsion-cpp
Project that mimics the propulsion system of a satellite in C++

Use following command on a bash terminal to compile program:
    g++ fire_propulsion.cpp -o fire_propulsion -pthread

Use the following command to run program:
    ./fire_propulsion

The reason I chose to use C++ as the programming language for this program was because it's the programming language I feel the most comfortable programming in for Embedded Systems software. It also has a similarity to Rust, which is the programming language that the Flight Software team uses at Umbra.
